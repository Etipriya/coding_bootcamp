# RNA Transcription

## Challenge

Given a DNA strand, return its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).

Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.

The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).

The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and uracil (U).

Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:

- G -> C
- C -> G
- T -> A
- A -> U

It should transcribe a DNA sequence to the corresponding RNA sequence. For example, ACGTGGTCTTAA to UGCACCAGAAUU.

### Note

- Write your tests in the file `index.spec.js` located inside the `__tests__` directory.
- Add the function in file `index.js`.
- Follow a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach.
