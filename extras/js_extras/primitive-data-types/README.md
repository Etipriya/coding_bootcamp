# Primitive Types

JavaScript has seven data types that are classed as primitive data types in JavaScript. All of these types, except objects, define immutable values, i.e. values which are incapable of being changed.

## Data Types

- String
- Number
- Boolean
- BigInt
- Symbol
- undefined
- null

**Note**: Function is a sub-type of the data type object but still classed as a function type

**Note**: Array is not a data type `array` but a data type of `object`

**Note**: In JavaScript variables do not have a data type and it is the value they are assigned with that have an associated data type

**Note**: Everything in JavaScript is an object, is `NOT TRUE`; however, it is easy to assume so with primitive data types like string have an object representation which allows for `String` methods to be used.
