# Help for the Homework

## A mixture of hints, and guidance:

### General Guidance

Honestly there's not a lot of guidance that can be given for this homework. You need to do the following:

1. Update your portfolio so that it features the most recent homeworks as well as Project 1.
   - YOU DO NOT NEED TO RE-CREATE YOUR PORTFOLIO! Save this for later on in the course.
2. Update your GitHub profile pinning the most recent homeworks AND your Project 1 repository.
3. Update your CV for a Developer role.
4. Update / Create a LinkedIn profile.
   Some examples of good LinkedIn profiles:
   - https://www.linkedin.com/in/colum-lynagh-44a637b2/
   - https://www.linkedin.com/in/kennethpopay/
   - https://www.linkedin.com/in/meedaxaahmed/
