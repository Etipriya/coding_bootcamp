# Help for the Project

## A mixture of hints, and guidance:

### General Guidance

Project 1 is going to be your first project working together with everyone as developers. You might have worked in teams before, but this is different as we need to manage not just ourselves, but our code interactions as well.

There's 2 big parts to this project:

1. Building out your application considering:

   - CSS Framework other than Bootstrap

     - It is very important you TRY other CSS frameworks out BEFORE you use them in the project, otherwise you might find it doesn't help you as much as you want.

       - Examples: TailwindCSS, MaterializeCSS, Material Design Lite, Bulma, Foundation for Sites, Skeleton, Semantic UI, Pure CSS, UI Kit
       - Source: https://dev.to/theme_selection/best-css-frameworks-in-2020-1jjh

     - This choice is important, frameworks like Tailwind are drastically different to Foundation or Bulma or Bootstrap - for example they build a button from multiple classes rather than just 'button' but that offers loads of flexibility.

   - Two Server Side APIs:
     - This should be two DIFFERENT APIs, these are not the same as Third Party APIs and again it is super important to try them out first BEFORE using it in your project.
       - You need to know that you can get data back from that API - and know HOW to get that data back.
       - There's no point trying to integrate it if you get a week into the project and it has a premium plan that you have to pay for :sob:
       - There's a list of APIs you can use in API_Resources.md
       - Some other links for public apis:
       - https://github.com/n0shake/Public-APIs
       - https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis

2. Presenting your application:
   - This should follow the plan in the README.md
   - Try and use a theme template for the slideshow, make this as professional as can be as University staff might be there!
   - Really showcase yourselves, the team, the product, celebrate what you've done!

Think about your management here, you need to use some form of Project Management, where you list out what tasks and requirements you need to do.

    Lots of different tools you can use:
    	- Github Projects (Found inside your Repository)
    	- Trello (Easy to use)
    	- Asana (Easy to use)
    	- Taiga
    	- Jira (This can get messy)

> Notice how low the weighting of your mark is with regards to technical criteria it's 25%. It's 20% of the marks for presentation and collaboration. If you don't work together and split up the work it will be clear and you'll lose marks.

### Specific things for Project 1:

1. You MUST use 2 server-side APIs
2. You MUST use client-side storage to store some data (localStorage)
3. You MUST NOT use javascript alert(), prompt(), confirm()
4. You MUST NOT use bootstrap, it MUST be another framework
5. It MUST be interactive and respond to SOME user input.
6. Your project idea MUST be unique and not a copy paste of somebody else's project.
7. Your group MUST clearly and concisely articulate the project idea (In both your README, Presentation and Classes).
8. Your presentation demo MUST use a live application github pages URL.
9. Your application must be submitted with a Github repository URL AND a Github Pages link.
10. All your code should follow the best practices for:
    - File structure, Naming conventions
    - Variables, Function naming, Indentation, Quality comments
    - MULTIPLE descriptive commit messages
11. Your README must be high quality with a Description, Screenshot, Links.
12. Your application should be intuitive and easy to navigate
    - Subjective criteria, but there's general rules to follow here:
      - Nothing should be hard to read, content should have space with clear margins etc.
      - Buttons to navigate around your project shouldn't be hard to find.
13. Your application style should be clean and polished
    - Chances are the CSS framework you choose will provide this out of the box.
14. Application is responsive
    - If we resize to an iPhone 5/SE, an iPhone X, an iPad, an iPad Pro, 1200x720, Fullscreen - at each of these sizes the application should be usable.
      - Some things can be forgiven on the iPhone 5/SE.
15. Presentation should be using some form of software:
    - Google Slides if free and allows for collaborative editing, but feel free to use something else if you want.
16. Each member of your group MUST speak during the presentation
17. Your presentation follows a consistent TEMPLATE / THEME
