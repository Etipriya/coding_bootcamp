# Help for the Homework

## A mixture of hints, and guidance:

### General Guidance

This homework is going to require us to work with more than just one new third party api - so not just jQuery, but Moment.js too!

It is a very popular library so google and stack overflow will be your best friend as well as the Moment.js docs!

You do NOT need to dynamically add each hour, but we DO need to add the HTML for each hour of the day. This is within the 'container' div on line 31.

We do NOT need to adjust the CSS, everything we need has been given to us so we need to read through the CSS styles already defined and figure out how to use them.

### Specific things for Homework 3:

1. Your application MUST be deployed and there should be no console logs / errors in the 'inspect element'.
2. The application MUST display timeblocks for standard business hours (9am - 5pm).
3. Each timeblock MUST contain an input field and a save button
4. Clicking on a timeblocks save button MUST save the input text to local storage
   - If you refresh the timeblocks information must still be there.
5. The current day MUST be displayed at the top of the calendar.
6. Each timeblock MUST be color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future.
