# Help for the Homework

## A mixture of hints, and guidance:

### General Guidance

1. Look through the description and make notes. Each point that the description makes should be written down.

2. The user story is there to give an overview of what you're doing 'the short version' or for the reddit users the 'TLDR'.

3. Acceptance Criteria might as well be the checklist for what you are doing. If you complete each part of the acceptance criteria, you will get 100%.

4. All the submission criteria and deployment information is included in the README.md. Revisit it when you've completed your work.

### Specific things for Homework 1:

1. This HAS to be deployed.
2. You must use `<article> <section> <header>` and other semantic elements.
3. Your HTML should have proper indentation.
4. Images should have their `alt` attribute defined.
5. The `<title>` should be concise.
6. All the links should work
7. Your CSS selectors should have a flow that matches the order of your html elements.
8. Your CSS should have comments explaining what each definition is doing (Nothing overboard but something generic).
9. Your repository HAS to have a unique name such as "homework_1_refactor"
10. You should have a README with a good description, screenshot of it working on your machine and a link to the deployed application.
    - Seriously - the screenshots will be respected it the reviewer cannot run your application for whatever reason!
11. You must be commiting your work after each feature/function/part of the homework is completed
