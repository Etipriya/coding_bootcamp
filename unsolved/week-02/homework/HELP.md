# Help for the Homework

## A mixture of hints, and guidance:

### General Guidance

1. We're not given any starter code for this homework which means we need to create the files from scratch ourselves!

An example of the structure is:

```
homework_2/
	assets/
		css/
			style.css
		images/
			my_photo.png
	index.html
```

> **This means as soon as we create our `homework_2` repo we MUST create our files ourselves, there's nothing to copy from the instructor repo**

2. The portfolio is all about showcasing our skills so we want to showcase our skills, who we are, the things we've worked on!

3. Part of this is using CSS making use of:

   - Flexbox
   - Media Queries
   - CSS Variables

4. If you don't have enough repositories to list on your portfolio, then put some placeholder projects for now - we're going to have 3 big projects from each phrase, and each homework is technically a proejct!

5. **YOU DO NOT NEED TO MIMICK THE MOCK UP - THIS IS AN EXAMPLE SHOWING ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS REQUIRED**

### Specific things for Homework 2:

1. This HAS to be deployed just like all of the other homeworks
2. Your full name should be present at the top of the portfolio
3. Your portfolio should have a picture of you somewhere, even if it's a tiny picture at 200px x 200px.
4. You need to have a navigation bar that links to the following sections in your portfolio:
   - About you
   - Your projects
   - Contact details
     > If you click a link in the nav bar it should jump to the sections like in homework 1!
5. Your projects section should have:
   - Titles as well as alt attributes for all images.
   - The FIRST project's image MUST be bigger than the others. Nothing drastic - say an extra 100px maybe?
     - Maybe we could show off with a pseudo selector? :wink:
6. Clicking on a project through either image or link should have open up the github repository for that project.
7. Your layout MUST adapt on different screen sizes. E.g. if I go into the chrome inspector, set it to responsive and change the screen width - the layout must change!
8. Your README MUST contain description, screenshots, links to the deployed application.
9. Make use of Semantic HTML and flex your knowledge! :muscle:
